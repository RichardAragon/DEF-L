# DEF-L
**DEfensive Formation-Lombardi Algorithm (DEF-L)**
The DEF-L algorithm is a defensive GAN algorithm that is inspired by American football. The DEF-L algorithm uses an MoE architecture for the discriminator model. There are three "types" of defensive players: defensive line, linebackers, and secondary. There is also a "coach".

The coach is fed the play-by-play analysis of what is happening in real time and is designed to make real-time substitutions and weight adjustments to strengthen the play of their team in any given scenario. The coach needs to be a very large parameter model, but the individual players could all be small parameter models. The coach has access to a "playbook", which is a database of algorithms, configurations, equations, and weight adjustments that it could utilize in any scenario to strengthen its team.

The coach is trained to recognize and classify adversarial strategies and translate them to "football plays". It then runs this vs an algorithm to figure out the best counter strategy to that particular category of football play. It can adjust the attributes of its players as well as the formations. For example, it could bring in a speedier secondary or a more compute-heavy defensive line if needed.

**Benefits of DEF-L**

The DEF-L algorithm has several benefits over traditional defensive GAN algorithms:

* It is more scalable. The individual discriminator networks can be relatively small and efficient, and they can be specialized for different types of adversarial attacks. This allows the algorithm to defend against a wide range of adversarial attacks without sacrificing performance.
* It is more robust to changes in the adversarial landscape. The coach model is able to learn and adapt to new adversarial strategies. This makes the DEF-L algorithm more resistant to adversarial attacks that are designed to exploit the weaknesses of traditional defensive GAN algorithms.
* It is more interpretable. The DEF-L algorithm is based on the rules and strategies of American football. This makes it easier to understand how the algorithm works and to identify potential weaknesses.

**Applications of DEF-L**

The DEF-L algorithm can be used to defend against adversarial attacks in a variety of applications, including:

* Image classification
* Natural language processing
* Computer vision
* Machine translation
* Fraud detection

**Conclusion**

The DEF-L algorithm is a promising new approach to defending against adversarial attacks. It is scalable, robust, and interpretable. The DEF-L algorithm can be used to defend against adversarial attacks in a variety of applications.
